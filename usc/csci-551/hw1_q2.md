(d) This paper provides a system and method to measure congestion on interdomain links without direct access to them, and runs some analysis scripts to get results.

(e) This paper gives us a complete process about how to measure the performance of interdomain links, how to infer congestion and how to validate the inference methods.  This paper also provides the result which is quite interesting.

(f) Idea-Experiment-Analysis. This paper arises some idea first, then design experiment and analyze the result with case studies.

(g) This paper could be improved if more details about the system and the most original ideas about this system are discussed.

(h) How to extend current system to a more complete visibility of all interdomain links with numerous VPs?

(i) If we consider different link capacities, how to measure the congestion?

(j) While discussing U.S. interdomain congestion, the paper metions the visibility of interdomain links is dynamic, which may have some impact to the results.

(k) Yes, it is important. The author not only provides the methods but also provides the interface for us to reproduct the experiments. This paper also gives some idea about how to reuse the methodology in a third party Internet.

(l) This paper is quite relative to Congestion avoidance and control [Jacobson88a]. Both of two papers are talking about congestion.

(m) Address the limitations discussed in the end of the paper.

(n) Develop a system, design methods and experiments and analyze the results.

(o) The published tools, data and interface which could be reused by the community for further research.

(p) The paper's methodology has several limitations like relying on router queueing, incomplete visibility, unknown root causes and without measuring link capacity.
