## Customer Obsession

Leaders start with the customer and work backwards. They work vigorously to earn and keep customer trust. Although leaders pay attention to competitors, they obsess over customers.

## Ownership

Leaders are owners. They think long term and don’t sacrifice long-term value for short-term results. They act on behalf of the entire company, beyond just their own team. They never say “that’s not my job". 

## Invent and Simplify

Leaders expect and require innovation and invention from their teams and always find ways to simplify. They are externally aware, look for new ideas from everywhere, and are not limited by “not invented here". As we do new things, we accept that we may be misunderstood for long periods of time.

## Are Right, A Lot

Leaders are right a lot. They have strong judgment and good instincts. They seek diverse perspectives and work to disconfirm their beliefs.

## Learn and Be Curious

Leaders are never done learning and always seek to improve themselves. They are curious about new possibilities and act to explore them.

## Hire and Develop the Best

Leaders raise the performance bar with every hire and promotion. They recognize exceptional talent, and willingly move them throughout the organization. Leaders develop leaders and take seriously their role in coaching others. We work on behalf of our people to invent mechanisms for development like Career Choice.

## Insist on the Highest Standards

Leaders have relentlessly high standards - many people may think these standards are unreasonably high. Leaders are continually raising the bar and drive their teams to deliver high quality products, services and processes. Leaders ensure that defects do not get sent down the line and that problems are fixed so they stay fixed.

## Think Big

Thinking small is a self-fulfilling prophecy. Leaders create and communicate a bold direction that inspires results. They think differently and look around corners for ways to serve customers.

## Bias for Action

Speed matters in business. Many decisions and actions are reversible and do not need extensive study. We value calculated risk taking. 

## Frugality

Accomplish more with less. Constraints breed resourcefulness, self-sufficiency and invention. There are no extra points for growing headcount, budget size or fixed expense.

## Earn Trust

Leaders listen attentively, speak candidly, and treat others respectfully. They are vocally self-critical, even when doing so is awkward or embarrassing. Leaders do not believe their or their team’s body odor smells of perfume. They benchmark themselves and their teams against the best.

## Dive Deep

Leaders operate at all levels, stay connected to the details, audit frequently, and are skeptical when metrics and anecdote differ. No task is beneath them.

## Have Backbone; Disagree and Commit

Leaders are obligated to respectfully challenge decisions when they disagree, even when doing so is uncomfortable or exhausting. Leaders have conviction and are tenacious. They do not compromise for the sake of social cohesion. Once a decision is determined, they commit wholly.

## Deliver Results

Leaders focus on the key inputs for their business and deliver them with the right quality and in a timely fashion. Despite setbacks, they rise to the occasion and never settle.









Work simulation(原则有先后顺序) 目前两大做题中最重要原则： 1.requirement排在第一，deadline第二。 2.有manager出现的选项无脑选manager，manager就是一个组的地头蛇。Amazon9条主要原则 原则1：客户是上帝，requirement优先，任何影响上帝的事情都不能干. 如某个requirement影响了上帝的体验， 你就是死键盘上也不能砍了，宁愿miss deadline 原则2：为长远考虑，即客户几年之后可能会出现的需求也要考虑到， 不会为了交付短期的deadline， 而牺牲长期的价值。（比如 global api 和 local api） 原则3：最高标准，“最高”对应上面的“长远”。 原则4：一般情况，能请示manager就请示manager，manager一般不会出错 原则5：速度很重要，决策和行动都可以改变，因此不需要进行过于广泛的推敲 ，但提倡在深思熟虑下进行冒险。 原则6：不需要一定要坚持“非我发明”，需求帮助也是可以的，四处寻找创意 来源一亩，并且接受长期被误导的可能 原则7：敢于承担责任，任劳任怨，比如领导说谁会java，你会你就跳出来说我会 原则8：对问题刨根问底，探究细节 原则9：服从大局（团队比个人重要）

### General Questions

##### Self-Intro

- who+where+major
- tech stack
- experience
- interested in what in your company

I am Yiming Li, a master student at University of Southern California, major in Computer Science. I am concentrated on backend and I am solid in C++ and Python. And I interned at Microsoft Beijing Office during my undergraduate study. I am interested in Quora's infrastructure team and I am seeking an internship at Quora this summer.



##### Walk through your resume

Well, fisrt, I want to introduce myself. My name is Yiming Li. Currently, I am a graduate student at USC. I am pursuing my master degree in computer science. This semester is my first semester of my graduate study. And I am suppose to get my master degree in Dec. 2019. Before getting into USC, I got my bachelor degree at Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications. You can see my GPA in my resume. Yeah, I think I was a good student during my undergraduate study. My GPA was good and I ranked top 5 percent among over 300 students. Also, I won a scholarship each year. 

Beside that, I have some work experience during my undergraduate study. I interned twice at Microsoft as a software development engineer intern. Both of the time, I was at the Cloud and Artificial Intelligence Group. My team was called Azure Engineering team. During the internship, I mainly helped my team to build an IoT based STEM education platform. This is a non-profit project at Microsoft. We hope to use this platform to help children learn how to program. How to do that? We used a graphical programming language to teach children how to use variables, how to use functions, how to use data structure and many things like that. We had four people working for this project. My mentor and I focus on the backend. While another FTE and a intern, they focus on the frontend. During my first internship, I helped to build this platform from scratch. I implemented many APIs of the platform. Also, I developed a part of this platform which could let children control robots by using graphical programming language. To to this, I coded a compile pipline which could translate xml into Python. And the Pythod codes would be sent to the robots, and executed by the robot. When I interned at Microsoft for the second time, I delivered an image classification subsystem for our platform. This system used TensorFlow API and gRPC framework. Children could use this system to train and host their machine learning models by using graphical programming language. This system had two servers, one for training and another for serving models. The training server was used to train machine learning models and it was totally developed by me. While the serving server was used to manage and use the trained models. It was based on a pure C++ open source project. I made some small changes in this open source project in order to make it fit better for our platform. More specifically, I modified the number of worker threads and some argument about the timers. I used Docker to wrap two servers as a microservices. 

My internship experience did teach me a lot of things. I really learned how to work with my teammates, how to manage my project, how to solve some problem I have ever met, and many things like that. I really enjoyed my internship at Microsoft because I could get a chance to make some impact for our team, not just fix some bugs, but a chance to build a big project from scratch. During my internship, I touched a lot of open source project like gRPC, Jenkins, Kubernates and TensorFlow. I really interested in this kind of projects. I want to become a system level engineer in my future career, and I do want to join a small but potential team which could give me more chance to make some impact for my team. So, I am really interested in Akuna's C++ internship. It is top on my list. 

Beside my internship, I also make some contribution to the open source community. I list two projects in my resume. I don't want to spend too much time in the first project, because it doesn't have any connection with C++. I want to talk about the second one. In this project, I added two new optimizer for TensorFlow. TensorFlow is an open source machine learing framework. It has a C++ backend and a Python frontend. While developing the new features, I 

added some new C++ templates to calculate the gradient for my new optimizer and registered my new method. Then I used SWIG, called Simplified Wrapper and Interface Generator, to wrap my C++ codes, so that this codes could be used by Python frontend. Of course, both of the optimizers I added could train the machine learning models. This project is actually the capstone project for my undergraduate program. And I also wrote a small paper to explain this project. When I defended my paper, the professors thought highly of my work. 

That is all about my resume. 



##### How to deal with the conflicts with teammates? The most difficult guy to work with(none)?

* All teammates want to finish our job, so no conflict can not be solved, we have the same goal
* Put other things aside, focus on solving the disagreement
* Don't question others unless I have a strong support, not same as me doesn't mean they are wrong
* discuss more
* anthing benefits our goal should be done

##### How to work with teammate who is not reliable?

* talk with him more and try to help
* try to clarify everyone's task, clear the misunderstand
* write down the contract like API, on email or wiki
* clear the ddl
* if necessary, talk to my manager, we can't delay our progress
* 

##### If given offer, will you accept? Do you have other offers?

Of course I will sign. The course load for my new semester is really heavy. I need to keep learning new things and I do not want to be distracted from internship seeking. I don't have other offers because I started to apply internship too late.



##### What do you value in your internship?

* infra or backend related team
* experience working in an English environment in USA
* a chance to do a system related project
* a chance to step further in software engineering
* a chance to work for a product
* impact
* 

##### Most challenge project? Talk about your projects?

* what to do
* tech
* challenge+how to overcome
* your contribute
* 

##### Talk about one thing needing tradeoff/sacrifice

intern at Microsoft

* I got a chance to intern at Microsoft, but the workload for that semester is quite heavy
* I insisted on my internship, so I didn't get a quite good grade that semester
* But I think it worth. I know more about the industry, I know what I am really interested in, not just following others in machine learning

##### Biggest mistake

Starting to seek internship too late.

* it is common to have failure, find out why
* I need to keep learning, I feel wasting my time and I hope to get an internship ASAP
* 

##### Do you try to break rule and turn it out a good result?

Image classification system: not train from scratch but using a pretrained model

* my mentor's idea is to find a good neural network and train that using a small data set, or we train some models and pretend training.
* I find some articles about using pretrained models and I presuaded my mentor to have a try, which turned out a good result

##### What do you unsatisfy about your previous internship?

* don't have unsatisfications, thanks for my mentor and my teammates
* regret not be able to work for Azure, because of graduation
* do not talk with other teammates, to get some advice for my future career
* (positive focus; learned from the previous; improve in the future)
* I could optimize the image system better by using goroutine, but I didn't have time because of graduation.

##### Talk about your biggest weakness

* Sometimes stick to my own points
* no experience in infra, but other valuable experience(to do next, to improvement), experience in machine learning, which would be helpful, experience in open source
* (something to improve, but not the thing to get the job, infra may not a good choice; pick simple things; at least three weakness)
* working on infra; your plan

##### If your project can't be finished before ddl, what will you do?

* work harder and try to finish before ddl
* order the tasks according to their priority and work on the most important things first
* talk with my manager, and ask whether we can give up some unimportant features
* some projects have many test process, if we can ensure the quality of the project, maybe we can jump some tests and do that after ddl
* find out why we can not finish before ddl, avoid the problem next time

##### If your teammate fall behind, what will you do?

* finish my tasks first, and try to help him
* let other teammates help him, and try to find out why he fall behind, solve this problem
* if my teammate will delay team's speed, report to my manager, put team's benefit first



##### Where do you see yourself in five years?

* I hope to become an infrastructure engineer, and I hope to learn some basic skills in frontend, which could make me better to corroprate with other teams
* Become a superviser and use my skills to support others, my team and my company
*
