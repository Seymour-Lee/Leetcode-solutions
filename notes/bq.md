描述经历的时候从四个方面讲：situation、task、action、results



## General

### (Done) Self Intro

My name is Yiming Li, a master student at University of Southern California, major in Computer Science. I am a fullstack engineer and I am solid in C++ and Python. I have some work experience and I interned at Microsoft during my undergraduate study. I am interested in Amazon's SDE internship, and I hope to work at Amazon this summer.





### (Done) Why Amazon?

Well, Honestly, I am a big fan of Amazon. I really enjoy shopping on Amazon, because Amazon cares about their customers so much. You know, sometimes I buy something wrong on Amazon, and I can always get my refund in a short time even without needing to send it back. I am a person who respect hard working and care a lot about customer experience, so the culture of Amazon really really attracts me a lot.

Also, Amazon has the most advanced technology in cloud computing, which I am really interested in. During my internship at Microsoft, I worked for the Azure team as a fullstack intern. I got a chance to work with many cloud services, and I do want to become a cloud engineer for my future career. Therefore, I believe Amazon is a place where I can learn a lot, and use my skills and experience to make things happen with a team. 



### (Done) Confilct

- 受到强烈质疑该怎么办
- Tell me about a time when you had difficulty working with someone on a side or class project?
  What did you do to overcome this?
- how to communicate with the teammate, if u guys have some disagreements.
- 和老板confilct？不存在的。My manager has more experience than me, so I definitely trust my manager's decision, I will always follow their decision.
- How to deal with the conflicts with teammates? The most difficult guy to work with(none)? Example
  - All teammates want to finish our job, so no conflict can not be solved, we have the same goal
  - Put other things aside, focus on solving the disagreement
  - Don't question others unless I have a strong support, not same as me doesn't mean they are wrong
  - discuss more
  - anthing benefits our goal should be done

Example:

​	When I interned at Microsoft, my mentor wanted me and another intern to deliver a machine learning model, which could be trained in a short time. We had two ideas. One was given by me, and another was given by my teammate. I thought we should use some special algorithms like transfer learning to train our model. While my teammate thought we should do fake training. When users push the train button on our website, we did not train actually, we just switch our api within some models we have trained. You know, both of the ideas seemed good at that moment, and we can not convince each other. So we talked with our mentor, and my mentor decided to try both plans. You know, if I have some disagreement with my teammate, the first thing I will do is talking with him. If we can find a better solution, that would be pretty good. If we can not, I will encourage my teammate to talk with manager with me. You know, I believe all teammates want to finish out job, we have the same goal, so no confilct can not be solved. Talking and discussing is the best way to solve that. Anything benefits our final goals should be done.

### (Done) Mistake

- 描述一件你曾经失败的事情  一个没有克服的困难  讲一件没有达成自己目标的事情
- 违背过的承诺
- The biggest mistake you made and what did you learn from it?  (earn trust, customer obsession)
- 一个是项目中犯过的错误，what’s the biggest mistake/failure you’ve made?

Mistake Example:

The biggest mistake I have made happened when I interned at Microsoft. While developing, we use different dev environment. I used Linux and some teammates used windows. Because we were developing our prototype, our first verison, we did not have very strict code review. I imported a dynamic library into our project, but this library could not be compiled in Window. After my teammate merged my codes, they could not compile in their computer. I found this problem very quickly, and I rolled back my commit immediately. After that I apologized to my teammates and my mentor. And I started to find another way to solve that problem.

Not Reaching Goal or Disobey your word Example:

During my thrid year of undergraduate study, I got a chance to intern at Microsoft, but the workload of that semester is quite heavy. But I insisted on my internship and I hoped to get a good GPA at the same time. Unfortunely, I failed to reach that. Although my GPA was still good, but it was a little bit lower than before. But I think it worth because I got a chance to know more about the industry, I know what I am really interested in.





- CUSTOMER OBSESSION: *Walk us through a time when you helped a customer through a difficult process and what that looked like.*

- - leaders start with the customer and work backwards. They work vigorously to earn and keep customer trust. Although leaders pay attention to competitors, they obsess over customers.

  - - case 1

    - - Last year in Telamon, I took on and led a project of developing a web application for our Telecom engineering team, in order to help engineers build and manage detail specifications easily for their Telecom installation jobs. The detail specification building process was sort of complex, involving a lot of data entry and field data collection, and the requirement documentation provided to us was brief and totally in text description.
      - Therefore, it is challenging for me to come up with an intuitive and engineer-friendly design.
      - In order to understand the process thoroughly, I made several appointments with the engineering team, going through the specification building process with them step by step in detail. Then, I did some field observations, looking at how engineers use their [ipad](http://amzn.to/2MkVGMU)s and computers in the field and in the office, when and how they input the data to complete a detail specification. Based on what I’ve learned and observed, I was able to come up with data schemas, draft a working prototype, and bring it to the engineers to collect feedback.
      - It turned out that the prototype was very helpful, it saved us around 10% time when implementing the web application. After the production was released, the engineers tried and loved it immediately. They said they took less time building a specification now  with less error. The customer was obsessed with our professional process and result, and start to have more business with us.

    - case 2  (customer obsession and ownership, highest standard)

    - - In Telamon, once I led the team to implement an AP processing service for one of our client - Hubert Corporation. We provide a customized AP processing system as well as a team of AP clerks to help Hubert process their invoices. Since invoices from different vendors might require different ways of processing and our client didn’t have a full instruction for that (they usually process invoices based on their knowledge and familiarity), we had to spend time emailing back and forth dicussing about instructions whenever there was a special invoice processed incorrectly.
      - I looked at the invoices reported and thought we could do better in managing different invoices, vendors and corresponding instructions, and thus reducing the communication effort put by the client and us.
      - I first created a shared matrix and recorded all the invoices and instructions provided, and asked our AP clerks to update it as long as there was any new invoice feedback from the client. Then based on the analysis of the matrix, I created a checklist listing certain type of error-prone invoices and asked our AP quality managers to check on these type of invoices every day. Further, I programed and applied notifications for several type of invoices with special instructions in the system, so that our AP clerks didn’t have to watch out for them all the time.
      - After several weeks of running the service, I scheduled a meeting with the client and reviewed the matrix with them, they were impressed by it. And they even used the matrix as the instructions on their side. After a month or two, we barely got any email about incorrectly processed invoices from the client. We obsessed our client with our great quality and attitude to insist on the highest standards.

      

    

- OWNERSHIP: *Give me a example of when you took a risk and it failed.*

- - *leaders are owners. They think long term and don’t sacrifice long-term value for short-term results. They act on behalf of the entire company, beyond just their own team. They never say “That’s not my job”.*

  - - case 1

    - - I’d like to talk about one of my project at BitTiger. BitTiger had a bootcamp course for project managers and I was hired as the lead developer to help implement the idea driven by the project managers teamed with me.
      - Our task was to improve BitTiger's current communication channels between teachers and students, and integrate them more with its official web portal.
      - Since I was the person who was going to lead another developer to build the product, it was important for me to understand the user needs and the decisions made by the project manager thoroughly. The best way to do so was to actively take part in the decision making process from the very beginning. Therefore, for most of the activities hosted by the project managers, I asked to join them, like, taking notes while the project managers were interviewing with teachers and students, coming up with suggestions while they were discussing about user personas and stories, offering help while they were building wireframes, and joining discussion when they were creating and prioritizing tasks.
      - I was able to implement the product quickly because I totally understood what the project managers wanted. We didn't need to spend time communicating the requirements again. With the time saved, I was able to add more customized features making the product easier to use. On the demo day, we had a great presentation and received very good reviews.

    - case 2

    - - the communication feature is not easy to use, only remind the client you received a new message and log in. The client didn't log in to the system very often. Sometimes the client just email back to me saying what happened.
      - I took the ownership to support this project, I designed a new process by delivering the content to the kitchen designer and bring it to the client to discuss. the client agreed. After deliver, our customer support team has reduced around 70% support request for this project.

      

    

- INVENT AND SIMPLIFY: *Tell me a time when you created an innovative product.*

- *Leaders expect and require innovation and invention from their teams and always find ways to simplify. They are externally aware, look for new ideas from everywhere, and are not limited by "not invented here". As we do new things, we accept that we may be misunderstood for long periods of time.* 

- - case 1

  - - question board, BitTiger need to manager a lot of things, like notification, link to the live course, questions, communication. We are overwhelmed at the first about inventing the process, thinking about a lot of ideas like group by different tabs, create with different categories. But I decided to keep it simple and stupid, we create the post for all purpose, but group it by weeks. All important notification on the top.
    - care more about look and feel rather than a lot of features

  - case 2

  - - The project we did for hartson kennedy was to help process their drawing and purchase order. The customers  usually order countertops in their stores and kitchen designers then doing the drawings and generate PO paperwork, and send to us. However, the kitchen designer only uses fax machine, but we didn't have fax machine.
    - Instead of just purchasing a fax machine and assigning a person to handle the scanning everyday, I googled and did a research online first. I found a service that can receive the fax via email. I created a distribution list and registered it as the receiving mailbox.
    - With the simplified process, we don’t have spend money and time dealing with fax machine and scanning.  I invented and simplified the fax receiving process and saved money for our company.

    

  



- ARE RIGHT, A LOT: *Tell me about a time when you observed two business* o*pportunities to improve* *ROI, and how did you determine that they were connected.*

- *Leaders are right a lot, they have strong judgment and  good instincts. They seek diverse perspective and work to disconfirm their beliefs.* 

- - *tell me about a time when you are wrong*

  - *tell me about a time when you had to work with incomplete data or information*

  - *make a decision, but also consider the opinions of the other people* 

  - case 1

  - - we have a indexing team in china that helps enter the data on the invoice, I designed the indexing panel for them. Before making the decision, I decided to talk to the staff who are doing the data entry. Ask them to try and record the time and provide feedback. It turned out that they have some very good point of view, like amount match, required text-box color. And I changed my design and improve 10% processing time.

  - case 2

  - - once I argue with the manager about issue the corporate email, I want to register emails from MS and Gmail for business use because Telamon email sometimes blocks, and we have to contact Telamon IT which are not very responsible. The manager disagree at first, he said the corporate email is more professional. I collected the issue happened, and the impact on the client, feedback from them, average time IT reach and solve the problem, it turned out that we cannot bare it. then the manager agrees to switch as long as we can get a good domain name. We then applied a domain based on coporate and the name of our department. Everyone is happy.

    

  

- LEARN AND BE CURIOUS: *How do you find the time to stay inspired, acquire new knowledge, innovate in your work?*

- - *Leaders are never done learning and always seek to improve themselves. They are curious about new possibilities and act on explore them.*

  - - case 1

    - - I recently learned how Redux architecture and how it work
      - actions, global status, dispatch actions

    - case 2

    - - how large company deploy their front-end
      - how to cache

      

    

- HIRE AND DEVELOP THE BEST: *Tell me about a time when you had to deal with a poor performer on your team.*

- - *Leaders raise the performance bar with every hire and promotion. They recognize exceptional talent, and willingly move them throughout the organization. Leaders develop leaders and take seriously their in coaching others. We work on behalf of out people to invent mechanisms for development like Career Choice.* 

  - - case 1

    - - for the data entry team in China, they didn’t care much about the system before. When I led the project, I will  invite them to join the meeting, tell them I we develop the system, teach them how to test and ask them to feel free to give me feedback if they any idea. they are the direct users of the system.
      - finally these employees are very helpful for testing new features, and improve the efficiency of the indexing.

    - case 2

    - - When I transferring the projects from one person to another, I will co-work with them for a while, making sure the things they completely get the idea.

      

    

- INSIST ON THE HIGHEST STANDARDS: *Tell me about a time when you could have stopped working but persisted.*

- - *Leaders have relentlessly high standards - many people may think these standards are unreasonably high. Leaders are continually raising the bar and driving their teams to deliver high quality products, services and processes. Leaders ensure that defects do not get sent down the line and that problems are fixed so they stay fixed.*

  - - case 1

    - - hubert three way matching features, we have implemented the feature successfully. But I found the processor took long time to compare the amount of receipt, Purchase order, and invoice, calculate the tolerant percentage, identify any mismatches. I took the initiative to add exception handling features, instead of finding mismatches by eyes, I add a box to input and compare the amounts by the program.
      - it turned out the efficiency has improved a lot.

    - case 2

    - - client give us the ftp, and overwrite data everyday, sometimes if there is holiday, we may miss one or two load. I write a program to fetch the file and archive the data by date, so that we’ll always have the backup if there is any issue happened.
      - <http://www.codejava.net/java-se/networking/ftp/java-ftp-file-download-tutorial-and-example>

      

    

- THINK BIG: *Tell me about a time when you proposed a new business.*

- - *Thinking small is a self-fulfilling prophecy. Leaders create and communicate a bold direction that inspires results. They think differently and look around corners for ways to serve customers.*

  - - case 1

    - - augmented reality to find store

    - case 2

    - - ambient building

      

    

- BIAS FOR ACTION: *Describe how you would handle a busy situation where three people are waiting for help from you*.

- - Speed matters in business. Many decisions and actions are reversible and do not need extensive study. We value calculated risk taking.

  - - case 1

    - - the other engineer and I discussed for a couple hours, figured out what we disagreed on, and I suggested that neither answer was necessarily better. She agreed. I said that unless she had any new info, I’d rather we just pick mine, and we could always come back to the decision later if we learned something new.
      - example??

    - case 2

    - - 

      

    

- FRUGALITY: *Tell me about a time where you thought of a clever new way to save money for the company.*

- - *dd*

  - - case 1

    - - for most of internal tools, we’ll google first instead of developing by ourself.

    - case 2

    - - USL, this project is a little hurry, we don’t have enough resources for that. Average of processing one load takes around 4.5min, and we watch all the steps, automatically whatever we can, and reduce the process time to 2 min finally.

      

    

- EARN TRUST: *Tell me a time when you earned trust of a group.*

- - *Leaders listen attentively, speak candidly, and treat others respectfully. They are vocally self-critical, even when doing so is awkward or embarrassing. Leaders do not believe their or their team’s body order smells of perfume. They benchmark themselves and their teams against the best.*

  - - *vocally self critical*
    - *The biggest mistake I’ve made happened when I took on and led a project for the first time by myself. I got a requirement from the client about updating parts of a certain workflow. I listed the requirements,* *developed* *with the team, and released the update to the demo system on time, however, the client tried and didn’t like it.*
    - I diagnosed the system immediately, It turned out that we paid a lot of attention on the changes the client requested us to do, but didn’t do much evaluation on other features that are impacted by the change. A solid evaluation and design was necessary in this case because all the features in the workflow were closely connected to each other, and even a small change might cause butterfly effect.
    - I apologized to the client immediately and asked if we could have an extended deliver date. Luckily the client agreed and also showed understanding. Then I called a meeting with the dev team, walked through the whole workflow step by step together, evaluated all the possible operations that user might take on each step and then tailored the change we were gonna make accordingly. We then released a tentative version to the demo system before the deadline , walked through it with the client, and collected any feedback provided.
    - Finally, we delivered the update to the production successfully, our client was very happy and used it every day without any trouble yet.

    

- DIVE DEEP: *Tell me about a time when you had to dive deep into the data and the results you achieved.*

- - *trust but verify*

  - - *you believe the person but check the facts anyway*

  - *Leaders operate at all levels, stay connected to the details, audit frequently, and are skeptical when metrics and anecdote differ. No task beneath them.* 

  - - case

    - - 

      . 1point3acres

    

- HAVE BACKBONE, DISAGREE AND COMMIT *: Tell me about the most difficult interaction you had at work.*

- - *Leaders are obligated to respectfully challenge decisions when they disagree, even when doing so is uncomfortable or exhausting. Leaders have conviction and are tenacious. They do not compromise for the sake of social cohesion. Once a decision is determined, they commit wholly.*

  - - disagree with boss?

    - - If I have different idea with my manager or boss, I will try to collect data or make a prototype trying to convince him. If I have tried my best and he still disagree, then I would respect his decision and start committing for that.
      - when we released the service for US Logistics. The client complaint that some invoices were missed. I checked around and found that Telamon Network blocked some of the emails sent by the client. I talked the problem to the network administrator and they couldn’t change the email restrictions due to the policy.
      - Therefore, I brought this problem up to my manager and suggested to register another business mailbox provided by gmail or microsoft. The manager disagreed at first because he thought it was unprofessional if we didn’t use our own corporate email domain. I thought solving this problem was more important because our client would lose the trust on the quality of our data. In order to convince him, I showed him the data of email missing rate and the impacts on our client, and also I registered a good domain name composed by our company and department name, so we could still be professional on that part.
      - Finally, the manager was convinced and agreed on my suggestion. We barely have any missed emails after we switched our mailbox. And because of the good result, we started to use the domain for other projects gradually.

      

    

- DELIVER RESULTS**:** Tell me about a time where you overcame an obstacle and delivered results.

- - leaders focus on the key inputs for their business and deliver them with the right quality and in a timely fashion. Despite setbacks, they rise to the occasion and never settle. 
  - - what you’d do after you realized you couldn’t hit the date?
    - - First, I’d check every possible way that could possibly make me hit the date, like using after-work time, weekends, or holidays, asking for help or suggestions, finding alternatives or simpler solutions, etc. Since I am the owner of the tasks, it’s my responsibility to deliver results on time. It’s my fault that I underestimated the workload when I took the tasks.
      - There was one time that we couldn’t finish the troubleshooting of a bug on time, the system should have sent out auto emails at 7:00 am but sometimes it failed. Before solving the problem, I will check each morning and manually trigger emails to the client.
      - If I still couldn’t hit the date, I would look at features, pick out a few with highest priority that I could finish, and then discuss about the problem with the project manager. Of course, I would apologize first and then try to discuss about the best solution to minimize the impacts. Once the project manager agrees, I would notify all the people that could be impacted by the delay.











### (Done) Project

* 需要很快时间学习一个新知识来完成的项目
* 有没有为了project深入理解package运作的经验
* talk about project你想做而不是出于学业／工作压力做的？
* 讲一个被困难stuck住的经历
* 之前经历过项目中最有挑战性 or most interesting的project
* 有没有做过stand out的project? 最自豪的经历  如何lead课程项目的

Example:

The most challenging project developed by me is an open source project. You can see this project on my resume, it is called mobilenet face dection. I developed this project when I was learning machine learning and how to use TensorFlow to train machine learning models. You know, machine learning is quite interesting, and most of time, it is hard to train a good model. To develop this project, I have to learn many things in a short time and in order to understand how TensorFlow works, I also read some source codes of TensorFlow. This project has got 23 stars on Github. That is a big encouragement for me.





### (Done) DDL

* 要compromise小細節來趕上的deadline（tradeoff）deadline 过后有没有做什么 improvement，怎么做
* 以往有限时间内必须拿出结果的经历，为什么选了某个特定的技术，有没有什么规划好却没有实现的功能
* 你没有在deadline之前完成任务的经历 Example
* ddl处理，完不成怎么办
* 因为时间不够而放弃的项目里的本应实现的feature
* deliver result, ownership

##### If your project can't be finished before ddl, what will you do?

- work harder and try to finish before ddl
- order the tasks according to their priority and work on the most important things first
- talk with my manager, and ask whether we can give up some unimportant features
- some projects have many test process, if we can ensure the quality of the project, maybe we can jump some tests and do that after ddl
- find out why we can not finish before ddl, avoid the problem next time

Example:

During my second internship at Microsoft, I helped my team to deliver an image classification system. However one day, my mentor told me the manager wanted to see our project at the end of that week, so I had to give my demo before that. I remember I only had 2 or 3 days, but I just started my project soon, so it was imposible for me to show all the functions we planned to do. Therefore, I talked with my mentor, and we decided to work harder and to finish the most important features first. We gave up some complicated design of our project and to use the most easy, most straight forward way to build our project. Finally, our demo was pretty good. The manager thought highly of our work. Of course, we tried to perfect our work after the presatation.







### (Done) Tradeoff

* how to choose between different technical stack? 
  * think about what you need
  * think about the future
* 自己做决定的经历
* 先解释项目，项目怎么展开的遇到了哪些困难技术trade off

intern at Microsoft

- I got a chance to intern at Microsoft, but the workload for that semester is quite heavy
- I insisted on my internship, so I didn't get a quite good grade that semester
- But I think it worth. I know more about the industry, I know what I am really interested in, not just following others in machine learning

Example:

这个例子也可以认为是一个没有达到commitment，但是我认为experience更重要，所以我做了tradeoff

During my thrid year of undergraduate study, I got a chance to intern at Microsoft, but the workload of that semester is quite heavy. But I insisted on my internship. Although my GPA is not quite good, but I think it worth. I got a chance to know more about the industry, I know what I am really interested in.

Example(Tech):

During my second time intern at Microsoft, my mentor wanted me to develop an image classification system by using TensorFlow for our website. At that moment I had two choice, one was to develop in Golang, because our server was developed in Go. Another choice was to develop it in Python, if we did this, we would have to build a microservice, which would be more complicate. Finally, I gave my plan to my manager and we decided to use Python in our project. We chose Python because it would benefit our future development, although we had to spend more time in development. You know TensorFlow's Python API is stable while Go's API is not. So using Python was a better choice for us.

## Customer Obsession

Leaders start with the customer and work backwards. They work vigorously to earn and keep customer trust. Although leaders pay attention to competitors, they obsess over customers.

客户第一位，哪怕牺牲自己的利益违背自己的准则，犯了错误要在顾客要求之前补偿

#### Question

感觉在这儿可以引申为Manager



## Ownership

Leaders are owners. They think long term and don’t sacrifice long-term value for short-term results. They act on behalf of the entire company, beyond just their own team. They never say “that’s not my job". 

优先考虑长期目标，一切都是我的工作

#### Questions

* Tell me about a time when you took on something significant outside your area of responsibility.  Why was it important?  What was the outcome?
* Give me an example of a time when you didn't think you were going to meet the commitments you promised.  How did you identify the risk and communicate it to stakeholders?  What was the outcome?
* 举一个例子，当你的peer在学业或者工作上陷入困难时，你是怎么做帮助他的，最后结果如何?
* 讲一个你帮同事分担任务的经历  帮助struggle队友的经历
* 如果项目进度很慢怎么办
* Describe a situation in which you took extra responsibility for a task that does not belong to you..



##### If your teammate fall behind, what will you do?

- finish my tasks first, and try to help him
- let other teammates help him, and try to find out why he fall behind, solve this problem
- if my teammate will delay team's speed, report to my manager, put team's benefit first

Example:

编一个帮新intern学东西的例子



## Invent and Simplify

Leaders expect and require innovation and invention from their teams and always find ways to simplify. They are externally aware, look for new ideas from everywhere, and are not limited by “not invented here". As we do new things, we accept that we may be misunderstood for long periods of time.

保持简单，为此要不断创新

Example:

transfer learning的例子改改

## Are Right, A Lot

Leaders are right a lot. They have strong judgment and good instincts. They seek diverse perspectives and work to disconfirm their beliefs.

Leader总是对的，哪怕态度180度转弯

* Tell me about a decision for which data and analysis weren’t sufficient to provide the right course and you had to rely on your judgment and instincts.  Give me two to three examples.  They don’t have to be big strategic decisions – could be big or small 
* Give me an example of when you have to make an important decision in the absence of good data because there just wasn’t any.  What was the situation and how did you arrive at your decision?  Did the decision turn out to be the correct one?  Why or why not?

Manager说啥都对就完了

## Learn and Be Curious

Leaders are never done learning and always seek to improve themselves. They are curious about new possibilities and act to explore them.

保持好奇心，自我提升

* What is the coolest thing you have learned on your own that has helped you better perform your job? 
* Tell me of a time when you took on work outside of your comfort area and found it rewarding?

Example:

23 Stars 的项目，改编一下

## Hire and Develop the Best

Leaders raise the performance bar with every hire and promotion. They recognize exceptional talent, and willingly move them throughout the organization. Leaders develop leaders and take seriously their role in coaching others. We work on behalf of our people to invent mechanisms for development like Career Choice.

雇最好的人，让他们发挥才能

## Insist on the Highest Standards

Leaders have relentlessly high standards - many people may think these standards are unreasonably high. Leaders are continually raising the bar and drive their teams to deliver high quality products, services and processes. Leaders ensure that defects do not get sent down the line and that problems are fixed so they stay fixed.

坚持最高标准

* Tell me about a time you wouldn’t compromise on achieving a great outcome when others felt something was good enough.  What was the situation? 
* Give me an example of a goal you’ve had where you wish you had done better.  What was the goal and how could you have improved on it?

Example:

编一个还能进一步优化的例子

transfer learning的例子，还有一个相似的问法是问优化project

## Think Big

Thinking small is a self-fulfilling prophecy. Leaders create and communicate a bold direction that inspires results. They think differently and look around corners for ways to serve customers.

顾客至上的前提下，着眼大局

* Give me an example of a radical approach to a problem you proposed.  What was the problem and why did you feel it required a completely different way of thinking about it?  Was your approach successful? 
* How do you drive adoption for your vision/ideas?  How do you know how well your idea or vision has been adopted by other teams or partners?  Give a specific example highlighting one of your ideas

## Bias for Action

Speed matters in business. Many decisions and actions are reversible and do not need extensive study. We value calculated risk taking. 

积极行动，快速前行，敢于冒险

* a situation you have to take a risks
* 如果项目进度很慢怎么办
* Give me an example of a calculated risk that you have taken where speed was critical.  What was the situation and how did you handle it?  What steps did you take to mitigate the risk?  What was the outcome?
* Describe a situation where you made an important business decision without consulting your manager.   What was the situation and how did it turn out?

Example:

老板出差了，结果打电话告诉我找Carter让我帮忙写个小demo，一天时间出结果，然后我就很努力很努力，自己做决定，和product manager积极沟通技术细节，最后如期完成，customer很满意

## Frugality

Accomplish more with less. Constraints breed resourcefulness, self-sufficiency and invention. There are no extra points for growing headcount, budget size or fixed expense.

节俭，投入最小产出最大

## Earn Trust

Leaders listen attentively, speak candidly, and treat others respectfully. They are vocally self-critical, even when doing so is awkward or embarrassing. Leaders do not believe their or their team’s body odor smells of perfume. They benchmark themselves and their teams against the best.

赢得信任，并让人感觉被信任

* Give an example of a tough or critical piece of feedback you received.  What was it and what did you do about it? 
* Give me an example of an idea you had that was strongly opposed.  Why was there so much resistance?  How did you handle the negative feedback?

Example:

transfer的改一下

## Dive Deep

Leaders operate at all levels, stay connected to the details, audit frequently, and are skeptical when metrics and anecdote differ. No task is beneath them.

深入研究，不同时要怀疑

* a situation or tast you have to dive in
* Tell me about a time you were trying to understand a problem on your team and you had to go down several layers to figure it out.  Who did you talk with and what information proved most valuable?  How did you use that information to help solve the problem? 
* Tell me about a problem you had to solve that required in-depth thought and analysis?  How did you know you were focusing on the right things?

Example:

open source的改一下

## Have Backbone; Disagree and Commit

Leaders are obligated to respectfully challenge decisions when they disagree, even when doing so is uncomfortable or exhausting. Leaders have conviction and are tenacious. They do not compromise for the sake of social cohesion. Once a decision is determined, they commit wholly.

有决心处理分歧，一旦作出决定，就完全遵从

* Tell me about a time that you strongly disagreed with your manager on something you deemed to be very important to the business.  What was it about and how did you handle it? 
* Give me an example of when you took an unpopular stance in a meeting with peers and your leader and you were the outlier.  What was it, why did you feel strongly about it, and what did you do?

## Deliver Results

Leaders focus on the key inputs for their business and deliver them with the right quality and in a timely fashion. Despite setbacks, they rise to the occasion and never settle.

克服一切困难达到目标

* Tell me about a goal that you set that took a long time to achieve or that you are still working towards.  How do you keep focused on the goal given the other priorities you have? 
* Tell me about a time where you not only met a goal but considerably exceeded expectations.  How were you able to do it?  What challenges did you have to overcome?







Work simulation(原则有先后顺序) 

目前两大做题中最重要原则： 

* 1.requirement排在第一，deadline第二。 
* 2.有manager出现的选项无脑选manager，manager就是一个组的地头蛇。

Amazon9条主要原则 

* 原则1：客户是上帝，requirement优先，任何影响上帝的事情都不能干. 如某个requirement影响了上帝的体验， 你就是死键盘上也不能砍了，宁愿miss deadline 
* 原则2：为长远考虑，即客户几年之后可能会出现的需求也要考虑到， 不会为了交付短期的deadline， 而牺牲长期的价值。（比如 global api 和 local api） 
* 原则3：最高标准，“最高”对应上面的“长远”。 
* 原则4：一般情况，能请示manager就请示manager，manager一般不会出错 
* 原则5：速度很重要，决策和行动都可以改变，因此不需要进行过于广泛的推敲 ，但提倡在深思熟虑下进行冒险。
* 原则6：不需要一定要坚持“非我发明”，需求帮助也是可以的，四处寻找创意 来源一亩，并且接受长期被误导的可能 
* 原则7：敢于承担责任，任劳任怨，比如领导说谁会java，你会你就跳出来说我会 
* 原则8：对问题刨根问底，探究细节 
* 原则9：服从大局（团队比个人重要）







\1. Tell me a challenge you had where the best way forward was not clear cut. How did you decide what to do?

\2. Give me an example of something you tried to accomplish but failed.

\3. Give me an example of a time when you showed initiative.

\4. Give me an example of a time when you motivated others.

\5. Tell me about a time when you delegated a project effectively.

\6. Tell me about a time when you coached someone.

## Basic

### General Questions

##### Self-Intro

- who+where+major
- tech stack
- experience
- interested in what in your company

I am Yiming Li, a master student at University of Southern California, major in Computer Science. I am concentrated on backend and I am solid in C++ and Python. And I interned at Microsoft Beijing Office during my undergraduate study. I am interested in Quora's infrastructure team and I am seeking an internship at Quora this summer.



##### Walk through your resume

Well, fisrt, I want to introduce myself. My name is Yiming Li. Currently, I am a graduate student at USC. I am pursuing my master degree in computer science. This semester is my first semester of my graduate study. And I am suppose to get my master degree in Dec. 2019. Before getting into USC, I got my bachelor degree at Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications. You can see my GPA in my resume. Yeah, I think I was a good student during my undergraduate study. My GPA was good and I ranked top 5 percent among over 300 students. Also, I won a scholarship each year. 

Beside that, I have some work experience during my undergraduate study. I interned twice at Microsoft as a software development engineer intern. Both of the time, I was at the Cloud and Artificial Intelligence Group. My team was called Azure Engineering team. During the internship, I mainly helped my team to build an IoT based STEM education platform. This is a non-profit project at Microsoft. We hope to use this platform to help children learn how to program. How to do that? We used a graphical programming language to teach children how to use variables, how to use functions, how to use data structure and many things like that. We had four people working for this project. My mentor and I focus on the backend. While another FTE and a intern, they focus on the frontend. During my first internship, I helped to build this platform from scratch. I implemented many APIs of the platform. Also, I developed a part of this platform which could let children control robots by using graphical programming language. To to this, I coded a compile pipline which could translate xml into Python. And the Pythod codes would be sent to the robots, and executed by the robot. When I interned at Microsoft for the second time, I delivered an image classification subsystem for our platform. This system used TensorFlow API and gRPC framework. Children could use this system to train and host their machine learning models by using graphical programming language. This system had two servers, one for training and another for serving models. The training server was used to train machine learning models and it was totally developed by me. While the serving server was used to manage and use the trained models. It was based on a pure C++ open source project. I made some small changes in this open source project in order to make it fit better for our platform. More specifically, I modified the number of worker threads and some argument about the timers. I used Docker to wrap two servers as a microservices. 

My internship experience did teach me a lot of things. I really learned how to work with my teammates, how to manage my project, how to solve some problem I have ever met, and many things like that. I really enjoyed my internship at Microsoft because I could get a chance to make some impact for our team, not just fix some bugs, but a chance to build a big project from scratch. During my internship, I touched a lot of open source project like gRPC, Jenkins, Kubernates and TensorFlow. I really interested in this kind of projects. I want to become a system level engineer in my future career, and I do want to join a small but potential team which could give me more chance to make some impact for my team. So, I am really interested in Akuna's C++ internship. It is top on my list. 

Beside my internship, I also make some contribution to the open source community. I list two projects in my resume. I don't want to spend too much time in the first project, because it doesn't have any connection with C++. I want to talk about the second one. In this project, I added two new optimizer for TensorFlow. TensorFlow is an open source machine learing framework. It has a C++ backend and a Python frontend. While developing the new features, I 

added some new C++ templates to calculate the gradient for my new optimizer and registered my new method. Then I used SWIG, called Simplified Wrapper and Interface Generator, to wrap my C++ codes, so that this codes could be used by Python frontend. Of course, both of the optimizers I added could train the machine learning models. This project is actually the capstone project for my undergraduate program. And I also wrote a small paper to explain this project. When I defended my paper, the professors thought highly of my work. 

That is all about my resume. 



##### How to deal with the conflicts with teammates? The most difficult guy to work with(none)?

* All teammates want to finish our job, so no conflict can not be solved, we have the same goal
* Put other things aside, focus on solving the disagreement
* Don't question others unless I have a strong support, not same as me doesn't mean they are wrong
* discuss more
* anthing benefits our goal should be done

##### How to work with teammate who is not reliable?

* talk with him more and try to help
* try to clarify everyone's task, clear the misunderstand
* write down the contract like API, on email or wiki
* clear the ddl
* if necessary, talk to my manager, we can't delay our progress
* 

##### If given offer, will you accept? Do you have other offers?

Of course I will sign. The course load for my new semester is really heavy. I need to keep learning new things and I do not want to be distracted from internship seeking. I don't have other offers because I started to apply internship too late.



##### What do you value in your internship?

* infra or backend related team
* experience working in an English environment in USA
* a chance to do a system related project
* a chance to step further in software engineering
* a chance to work for a product
* impact
* 

##### Most challenge project? Talk about your projects?

* what to do
* tech
* challenge+how to overcome
* your contribute
* 

##### Talk about one thing needing tradeoff/sacrifice

intern at Microsoft

* I got a chance to intern at Microsoft, but the workload for that semester is quite heavy
* I insisted on my internship, so I didn't get a quite good grade that semester
* But I think it worth. I know more about the industry, I know what I am really interested in, not just following others in machine learning

##### Biggest mistake

Starting to seek internship too late.

* it is common to have failure, find out why
* I need to keep learning, I feel wasting my time and I hope to get an internship ASAP
* 

##### Do you try to break rule and turn it out a good result?

Image classification system: not train from scratch but using a pretrained model

* my mentor's idea is to find a good neural network and train that using a small data set, or we train some models and pretend training.
* I find some articles about using pretrained models and I presuaded my mentor to have a try, which turned out a good result

##### What do you unsatisfy about your previous internship?

* don't have unsatisfications, thanks for my mentor and my teammates
* regret not be able to work for Azure, because of graduation
* do not talk with other teammates, to get some advice for my future career
* (positive focus; learned from the previous; improve in the future)
* I could optimize the image system better by using goroutine, but I didn't have time because of graduation.

##### Talk about your biggest weakness

* Sometimes stick to my own points
* no experience in infra, but other valuable experience(to do next, to improvement), experience in machine learning, which would be helpful, experience in open source
* (something to improve, but not the thing to get the job, infra may not a good choice; pick simple things; at least three weakness)
* working on infra; your plan

##### If your project can't be finished before ddl, what will you do?

* work harder and try to finish before ddl
* order the tasks according to their priority and work on the most important things first
* talk with my manager, and ask whether we can give up some unimportant features
* some projects have many test process, if we can ensure the quality of the project, maybe we can jump some tests and do that after ddl
* find out why we can not finish before ddl, avoid the problem next time

##### If your teammate fall behind, what will you do?

* finish my tasks first, and try to help him
* let other teammates help him, and try to find out why he fall behind, solve this problem
* if my teammate will delay team's speed, report to my manager, put team's benefit first



##### Where do you see yourself in five years?

* I hope to become an infrastructure engineer, and I hope to learn some basic skills in frontend, which could make me better to corroprate with other teams
* Become a superviser and use my skills to support others, my team and my company
*
